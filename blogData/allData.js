    long_description:
      "On face-value, ROCKY AUR RANI KII PREM KAHAANI may come across as yet another prem kahaani from Dharma. After all, KJo has a penchant for love stories, which is evident in his choice of films as a storyteller. However, ROCKY AUR RANI KII PREM KAHAANI packs a lot more than Rocky and Ranis romance in those [approx] 2.49 hours.Now to the pertinent question: Does KJo get it right? Oh yes, he does. ROCKY AUR RANI KII PREM KAHAANI wins Round 1 by casting the right names for the pivotal characters, namely Rocky [Ranveer Singh], Rani [Alia Bhatt] and the three stalwarts [Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan and Shabana Azmi]. Having said that, the real triumph lies in its storytelling, which surprises you at several points. More on that later!The plot *without* spoilers… Opposites attract! Rocky Randhawa [Ranveer Singh] and Rani Chatterjee [Alia Bhatt] are drawn towards each other, but realize that its not easy to win over their respective families. Thats when they hit upon the unique idea to switch places: Rocky will reside with Ranis family in her house, while Rani will move into Rockys palatial mansion and win over his family.Of course, theres another subplot that moves concurrently, but we arent revealing that.  ROCKY AUR RANI KII PREM KAHAANI is not an easy film to write and execute. Its clear that KJo has moved on with the times. This is evident in the screenwriting — its progressive and addresses societal issues. Also women empowerment. Additionally, KJo knows how to translate emotions on screen, an aspect that plays out in the third act of the film.Its fascinating to see how the women [Alia, Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Churni Ganguly, Kshitee Jog] take the centre stage this time. Sure, the men [Ranveer, Dharmendra, Aamir Bashir, Tota Roy Choudhury] are integral to the story, but the dramatic moments involving the women and some of the lines delivered by them are sure to leave an impact.",

    short_description: "ADIPURUSH, inspired from the Ramayana, is the story of Lord Rama rescuing Mata Sita from the evil Ravana. Raghav (Prabhas), the prince of Ayodhya, is sent on a 14-year vanvas (exile). ",
    long_description:"ADIPURUSH is based on the epic, Ramayana. Om Raut's adapted story is a classic. Clearly Om Raut, as a new generation film maker, and back with the accolades of his 2020 super hit film TANHAJI: THE UNSUNG WARRIOR, is driven to tell his eternal tale to a younger audience, that has grown up to VFX films and Super hero franchises from the likes of Marvel etc. To celebrate our own stories is not just laudable but indeed commendable for any storyteller. Some of the scenes are well thought out and interpreted. He also keeps the narrative simplified. However, one feels that Manoj Muntashir Shukla's dialogues could have been more impactful. The only dialogue that stands out is Raghavs speech before the climax battle.Om Raut's direction is first-rate. He doesnt rush through the narrative and takes his time to build the characters and the world in which the film is set in. The film is a visual spectacle and the way he has handled the grandeur is seen to be believed. The 3D effects also are nicely done. The use of the song ‘Jai Shree Ram is praiseworthy and it enhances the impact.On the flipside, the second half gets dragging. The climax fight goes on and on and makes viewers restless. Some of the CGI could have been better, knowing well that comparisons would be drawn to international films. You can make out that the film maker is keen to establish his own narrative of this tale and hence the dialogues too have perhaps been contemporised.ADIPURUSH starts on a lovely note. The visuals in the song 'Ram Siya Ram' are beautiful and the makers smartly and briefly explain the context and background and begin the story straight away from the vanvas track. Lankeshs entry is superb and so is the song 'Shivoham'. To show Lankeshs statues singing the song is cinematic brilliance. The first half is lengthier than the second half and yet, it is impactful. Some of the scenes that stand out in the first half are Lankesh kidnapping Janki, Raghav meeting Shabari, Bajrangs entry, Bajrang meeting Raghav for the first time, Sugriva and Vaalis fight and the intermission point. Post-interval, the film falls in certain scenes. The ‘sanjeevni booti episode and Raghavs speech are memorable sequences in this hour.",
